# Convolutional Neural Networks

The convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of deep learning neural networks. CNNs represent a huge breakthrough in image recognition. They’re most commonly used to analyze visual imagery and are frequently working behind the scenes in image classification. They can be found at the core of everything from Facebook’s photo tagging to self-driving cars. They’re working hard behind the scenes in everything from healthcare to security.
